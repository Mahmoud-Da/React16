REACT:
A JAVASCRIPT library for building user interfaces
developed by facebook

-The Heart of all REACT operations is components

components:
a piece of of user interfaces

How REACT development is working:

when we building application with REACT, we build a bunch of
independent, isolated,reusable, components
then compose them to build complex user interfaces

Every REACT application has at least one component, which refer
to as the root component.
this component represents the entire application and contains other
child components.

=> Every REACT application is essentially a tree of components

component is typically implemented as a JAVASCRIPT class that
has:
1- state
2- render (display image or objecte or algatrium)

state: is the date that we want to display when the component is rendered
render: is responsible for what should the UI looks like and the output
of the render method is REACT element which simple plain JAVASCRIPT object that react to
DOM element

the react element is not real DOM element it`s only represent it in memory
so react keeps lightweight representation of the DOM in memory which
refer to as the virtual DOM

Unlike the real DOM this virtual DOM is cheap to create, when we
change the state of a component, we got new react element,
REACT will then compare this element and it`s children with the prevois one,
it figures out what has changed, and then it will update a part of the
real DOM to keep it in sync with the virtual DOM

SO, => when we building the application with React Unlike vanilla JAVASCRIPT
and QueryJS we no longer have to work wuth the DOM API in browser.

So , when we changed the state REACT will automatically update the DOM to match
that state (That`s why it called REACT)
